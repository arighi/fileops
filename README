fileops kernel module
=====================

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an example kernel module to perform file operations from kernel space.

=== WARNING ===

Sit down and THINK before using this approach in your code!

Reading and writing a file within the kernel is a bad, bad, BAD thing to do.

You should never write a module that requires reading or writing to a file.
There are well-designed interfaces to exchange informations between kernel
and userspace: procfs, sysfs, block/char devices, etc...

That said, it is actually possible to do file I/O in the kernel, and this is
an example, but doing so is a severe violation of standard practice and it
can also lead to races and crashes.
